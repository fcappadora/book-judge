# Jusdge a Book

## About this project 

This project demonstrates the power and ease of implementation of computer vision using Roboflow.

This app is powered by a Roboflow workflow that accepts images as input. For this POC, images are expected to contain a book cover. The classification model utilizes the ViT Classification Model to analyze the input image and classify it as "like" or "dislike". After processing the image, the workflow returns the classification result as structured JSON to the consumer. The workflow is accessible via REST API.

The model was trained using ~60 book covers, pre categorized into likes and dislikes, provided by the developer. The model seeks to classify input covers based on visual similarity.

The front-end is built on Svelte-Kit using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI. It is hosted on Netlify.

## About this project

While judging a book by its cover isn't a good idea, we all do it! And publishers are well
aware. Considerable time, effort, and investment goes into designing a cover for each new
title. Sometimes this design can make or break the success of a book. 

While the POC app is a tongue and cheek app meant for a user to receive a prediction on whether or not they will like a book based on books theyâ€™ve previously read, a more practical application could be for a publisher to determine the efficacy of their design for new books. If a model were to be trained using sentiment data from GoodReads, or any other rating service, a vision model could be used to gauge how best to design covers for their title in production. 

The model could be expanded up to incorporate additional metadata like genre and themes, specific sales performance metrics, reader demographics, etc., in order to further guide the design team on capturing both the essence of the book as well as the attention of its target audience.
