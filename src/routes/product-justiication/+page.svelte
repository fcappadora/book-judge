	<p class="mb-4">
		While judging a book by its cover isn't a good idea, we all do it! And publishers are well
		aware. Considerable time, effort, and investment goes into designing a cover for each new title.
		Sometimes this design can make or break the success of a book.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		While the POC app is a tongue and cheek app meant for a user to receive a prediction on whether
		or not they will like a book based on books theyâ€™ve previously read, a more practical
		application could be for a publisher to determine the efficacy of their design for new books. If
		a model were to be trained using sentiment data from GoodReads, or any other rating service, a
		vision model could be used to gauge how best to design covers for their title in production.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The model could be expanded up to incorporate additional metadata like genre and themes,
		specific sales performance metrics, reader demographics, etc., in order to further guide the
		design team on capturing both the essence of the book as well as the attention of its target
		audience.
